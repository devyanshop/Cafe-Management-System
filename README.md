# Cafe Management System

## Introduction
This Cafe Management System is a Java project developed in NetBeans IDE using Java Swing. The system enables cafe operators to efficiently manage customer orders, automatically calculates purchase totals including tax, and generates receipts. By digitizing the order and billing process, this system is faster and easier to use compared to traditional paper methods. It streamlines cafe billing management and improves the efficiency of taking orders and handling payments.
